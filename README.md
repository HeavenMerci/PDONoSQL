# PDONoSQL
A bunch of classes in *PHP* based on a PDO connection to communicate with a database without bothering about SQL.

see (and execute) 'pdo_nosql.test.php' to see how it works.

**Sorry, comments will added later; But the module is intuitive and user-friendly.**
With an intellisense (or say a code completion) the ~~painful~~ works seems not painful anymore :smile:.
