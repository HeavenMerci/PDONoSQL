# PDONoSQL
A bunch of classes in *PHP* based on a PDO connection to communicate with a database without bothering about SQL.

- the main namespace is **pdonosql** having as sub-namespaces: **check** (for input+ouput checkers and their container/bag), **utils** (containing an autoload file and the helpful class **Utils** with static methods)
- the important class is **pdonosql\PDONoSQL**
- see (and execute) 'pdo_nosql.test.php' to see how it works.

**Sorry, comments will added later; But the module is intuitive and user-friendly.**
With an intellisense (or say a code completion) the ~~painful~~ works seems not painful anymore :smile:.
